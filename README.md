# operation-analysis-of-delivery-delay-and-pattern-
The project leverages shipment tracking data to uncover causes and distributions of delivery delays across cities and couriers, driving actionable strategies for operational improvements in logistics.
Delivery Delay Analytics Dashboard: README
Project Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of e-commerce delivery delays using Python and Tableau, aiming to uncover patterns, key issues, and actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

1. Problem Definition & Objectives
Frequent delivery delays reduce customer satisfaction and increase operational costs.
Objectives:

Identify patterns and causes of late deliveries.

Compare courier and city performance.

Visualize delay buckets and trends over time.

2. Data Collection & Sources
Source dataset: delivery_delay_cleaned-2.csv.

Key fields: Order_ID, Product, City, Courier, Promised_Date, Delivery_Date, Delay_Days, On_Time_Flag, Delay_Bucket, Delay_Capped.

Data gathered from e-commerce order fulfillment logs.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Duplicates dropped, missing values filled, categorical values standardized.

Dates converted to consistent format for correct calculations.

Final dataset ensures accurate exploration and visualization.

python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('delivery_delay_cleaned-2.csv')
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)
4. Data Exploration & Summarization
Used pandas for descriptive statistics: mean delay, percent late/on time.

Aggregated by Courier, City, Product to find outliers and top/bottom performers.

Weekly trends, delay buckets, total orders visualized in summary tables.

5. Data Visualization
Built interactive Tableau dashboards:

Weekly delivery delay trend (line chart)

Average delay by courier and by city (bar charts)

Delay bucket order counts (bar chart)

City vs courier delay heatmap

Product delay analysis (scatter/line)

KPI cards and summary tables for key metrics.

Visuals highlight critical issues and granular breakdowns.

6. Insights & Interpretation
Majority of delays fall in 1â€“2 Days Late bucket.

Certain couriers and cities consistently underperform.

Delay trends show operational bottlenecks and improvement opportunities.

Products with higher delays identified for further supply chain review.

7. Report & Presentation
Findings documented in a clear report, matching rubric categories.

All visuals and tables included for reference and grading.

Actionable recommendations provided: courier selection, city focus, product improvements.

Usage Instructions
Open the project directory and inspect the dataset (delivery_delay_cleaned-2.csv).

Use Python notebooks for initial cleaning and summarization.

Import clean dataset into Tableau for dashboard creation.

Refer to the report and visual slides for thorough project understanding.


This README ensures all rubric criteria are covered and guides users on setup, methodology, and results interpretation with clear next steps.
